Instructions for  running the simulator

Note : simulator was written and tested on windows If you encounter errors regarding
libraries pls install them and run again. Recommended to run on windows.

1. Makefile is available in the directory Part1 along with .cc and .h files for
    simulator, helper, node and main.cc
2. command "make" will generate an executable "sim.exe"
3. Usage: .\sim.exe --n <nodes> --m <m> --Ttx <T_tx> --Tk <Tk> --t <simEndtime> --e <disable_eclipse>
    where   n = no of nodes
            m = percentage of malicious nodes
            Ttx = average interval between two transaction created
            Tk = average block mining time
            t = run time of simulation
            e = if set to 0 disables the Eclipse attack
4. Output : 
    Runtime :
        You will see some checkpoints and lines in the following format which are self explanatory
    Eg: [514.394] Node :[59] - Mining Success : Block ID: [4664] Parent ID: [4617] No of Txns [103]
        [14864.7] MalNode :[0]  Hdepth :[0] Pdepth: [3]
    End of simualtion : 
        sim.exe genreates DIRECTORY logs with files peer<id>.txt conatining the tree of blocks arrival info and statistics according to the peer.

5. Visualization :
    sim.exe also generates blockchain.txt which contains two random Honest nodes, Ringmaster and a random malicious node.
    run python .\visualize.py which uses the blockchain.txt and respective Peer<id>.log files to generate block chain as viwed by them.

6. There are some inbuilt conditions in code
    simulator.h : MAX_BLK_SIZE -> max no of transactions in a block : 1000
    simulator.h : CAPITAL -> initial amount if money alloted to each node : 20
    simulator.h : MAX_TRANSACTIONS -> max no of transactions in the simulation
    simulator.h : MAX_BLOCKS -> max no of blocks generated in simulation
    you can see where they are used in the .cc file
