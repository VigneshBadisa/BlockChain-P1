Instructions for  running the simulator

Note : simulator was written and tested on windows If you encounter errors regarding
libraries pls install them and run again. Recommended to run on windows.

1. Makefile is available in the directory Part1 along with .cc and .h files for
    simulator, helper, node and main.cc
2. command "make" will generate an executable "sim.exe"
3. Usage: .\sim.exe --n <nodes> --z0 <z0> --z1 <z1> --Ttx <T_tx> --Tk <Tk> --t <simEndtime>
    where   n = no of nodes
            z0 = percentage of slow nodes
            z1 = percentage of low hashpower nodes
            Ttx = average interval between two transaction created
            Tk = average block mining time
            t = run time of simulation
4. Output : 
    Runtime :
        You will see some checkpoints and lines in the following format which are self explanatory
        [514.394] Node :[59] - Mining Success : Block ID: [4664] Parent ID: [4617] No of Txns [103]
    End of simualtion : 
        sim.exe genreates DIRECTORY logs with files peer<id>.txt conatining the tree of blocks arrival info and statistics according to the peer.
        At the end you will get rows for each peer in the format is_slow,is_highhash,n1,n2 where n1/n2 gives r value of the node.
        
5. Checking : The output across different peers should only differ at BLOCK RECVD TIME and node specific info
    the array printed shows the no of blocks in the longest chain mined by each peer which should be same for all files.

6. There are some inbuilt conditions in code
    simulator.h : MAX_BLK_SIZE -> max no of transactions in a block : 1000
    simulator.h : CAPITAL -> initial amount if money alloted to each node : 20
    simulator.h : MAX_TRANSACTIONS -> max no of transactions in the simulation
    simulator.h : MAX_BLOCKS -> max no of blocks generated in simulation
    you can see where they are used in the .cc file
